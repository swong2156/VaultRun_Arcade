    answer:
      "VaultRun is a Telegram-based crypto gaming arcade featuring 30 unique games where you can stake real cryptocurrency and win rewards. It's designed for fast-paced, exciting gameplay with real money transactions using WalletConnect technology.",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    category: "wallet",
    question: "How does wallet connection work?",
    answer:
      "VaultRun uses WalletConnect v2 to securely connect your crypto wallet. We support major wallets including MetaMask, TrustWallet, Coinbase Wallet, and more. Your private keys never leave your wallet, ensuring maximum security.",

    id: "3",
    category: "wallet",
    question: "Which cryptocurrencies are supported?",

      "We currently support ETH, USDT, BTC, MATIC, BNB, and DOGE. You can switch between currencies in the top-right currency selector, and all balances update in real-time.",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    category: "games",
    question: "How do the games work?",
    answer:
      "Each game has its own unique mechanics and win conditions. You choose your stake amount, play the game, and either win (receiving your stake plus profit) or lose (forfeit your stake). Games are designed to be quick (5-15 seconds) and exciting.",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    category: "games",
    question: "Are the game outcomes fair?",
    answer:
      "Yes! All games use provably fair algorithms. Game outcomes are determined by secure random number generation, and you can verify the fairness of each result. We don't manipulate outcomes in favor of the house.",
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    category: "rewards",
    question: "Are winnings real cryptocurrency?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! All stakes and winnings are real cryptocurrency transactions. When you win, the cryptocurrency is automatically sent to your connected wallet. When you lose, your stake is deducted from your wallet balance.",
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    category: "rewards",
    question: "How does the referral program work?",
    answer:
      "Share your unique referral link with friends. When they connect their wallet and start playing, you earn 5% commission on all their stakes automatically sent to your wallet. There's no limit to how much you can earn through referrals.",

    id: "8",
    category: "security",
    question: "Is VaultRun safe to use?",

  },
  {
    id: "9",
    category: "security",
    question: "What about gas fees?",
    answer:
      "Gas fees are required for blockchain transactions and are paid separately from your game stakes. The exact fee depends on network congestion and which blockchain you're using. We recommend using Polygon (MATIC) for lower fees.",
  },
  {
    id: "10",
    category: "wallet",
    question: "What happens if my transaction fails?",
    answer:
      "If a transaction fails or is rejected, no changes are made to your wallet balance. You'll see a user-friendly notification explaining what happened. Failed transactions don't affect your game or balance.",
  },
  {
    id: "11",
    category: "games",
    question: "Can I play without connecting a wallet?",
    answer:
      "Yes! You can try all games with mock balances when no wallet is connected. This lets you learn how each game works before playing with real cryptocurrency. However, winnings in demo mode aren't real.",

    category: "games",
    question: "Are there betting limits?",
